# The Rust Programming Languague 

This repository contains some study projects from my journey of studying rust programming by reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the%20rust%20programming%20language)
from Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.

It will also contain some exercises, code katas and other significant stuff related to rust programming.
