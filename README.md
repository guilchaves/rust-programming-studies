# Rust Programming Studies ðŸ¦€

This repository is a collection of my practical experiences in Rust, inspired by the readings from "The Rust Programming Language" by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, as well as "Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Rust" by Claus Matzinger. Codes, exercises, projects and notes from other sources may also be present.
